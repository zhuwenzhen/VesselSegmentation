How to build
------------

Requirements are:
 * C/C++ compiler (tested: GCC >= 4.6, Clang >= 3.1, ICC >= 14)
 * Eigen 3
 * Boost (tested: >= 1.52)
 * CMake >= 2.8.7

The basic procedure to build this port is as following:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 $ make

Some additional notes:
 * In order to use a different compiler, specify -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER and
   -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER
 * If you want debugging symbols, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 * If you want to make use of MKL, define MKLROOT and re-configure the project.
   In order to get a functional binary, you might want to bake the MKL library
   paths, reported by CMake as LD_LIBRARY_PATH, into your final binary using
   -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=${LIBRARY_PATH}"
